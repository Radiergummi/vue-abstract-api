 * Example posts API endpoint. As you can see, there's not much to do here for your typical REST API:
 * The endpoint path is figured out automatically from the class name, resulting in `/posts`.
 * This results in all typical operations being available: all, one, create, update, destroy.
 *
 * Head over to the Photos endpoint to view all available configuration options in detail.
